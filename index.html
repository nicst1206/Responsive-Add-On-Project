                <h4>The Next Generation</h4>
                <p>
                  Set in the latter third of the 24th century, when Earth is
                  part of the United Federation of Planets, it follows the
                  adventures of a Starfleet starship, the USS Enterprise
                  (NCC-1701-D), its captain Jean-Luc Picard and its crew in
                  their exploration of the Alpha quadrant and Beta quadrant in
                  the Milky Way galaxy.
                </p>
                <h5>First aired:</h5>
                <p>September 28, 1987</p>
                <h5>What I like about it:</h5>
                <p>
                  Captain Picard is by far the best captain in the franchise.
                  Filmed during the end of the 80s and into the 90s, this show
                  is filled with hope for humanity's future and is
                  ground-breaking with its diversity and inclusion.

                <h4>Voyager</h4>
                <p>
                  Set in the 24th century, when Earth is part of a United
                  Federation of Planets, it follows the adventures of the
                  Starfleet vessel USS Voyager, its captain Kathryn Janeway and
                  her crew as they attempt to return home to the Alpha Quadrant
                  after being stranded in the Delta Quadrant on the far side of
                  the galaxy.
                </p>
                <h5>First aired:</h5>
                <p>January 16, 1995</p>
                <h5>What I like about it:</h5>
                <p>
                  Captain Janeway was the first female captain of the franchise,
                  making her a trailblazer for women's equality. Also, the crew
                  being lost in a different quadrant offers countless
                  possibilities for new stories and conflicts.

                <h4>Prodigy</h4>
                <p>
                  Prodigy is the first Star Trek series to specifically target a
                  younger audience,[1][2] and the franchise's first solely 3D
                  animated series. It follows a group of young aliens in the
                  24th century who find the abandoned starship Protostar and
                  learn about Starfleet.

                <h5>What I like about it:</h5>
                <p>
                  Even though this is an animated series, I feel that this new
                  member in the franchise embodies the original spirit of Star
                  Trek far better than many of the other Shows. Targeted at kids
                  and teens, it will open up the franchise to a new and younger
                  audience.
